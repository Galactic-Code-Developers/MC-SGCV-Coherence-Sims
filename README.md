# MC–SGCV Coherence Sims

This repository contains a complete simulation suite for modeling quantum coherence decay, entropy flow, and energy transformation within the **Multifaceted Coherence (MC)** and **Superluminal Graviton Condensate Vacuum (SGCV)** frameworks.

## 🔬 Overview

In traditional physics, coherence loss is treated as an irreversible entropy increase. This project investigates a deeper hypothesis:

> **Coherence does not vanish. It transforms.**

Using symbolic tensor fields and 2D lattice simulations, these notebooks visualize and quantify how the observable field $\psi_s^\star$:
- Gradually loses coherence over time,
- Transfers energy into **ghost coherence**, **vacuum noise**, and **geometric curvature gain**, and
- May allow for **recondensation** from residual information encoded in spacetime.

## 📁 Structure

Each notebook lives in its own subfolder under `/notebooks/`, with its own `README.md`:

- `alpha_entropy_comparison_colab.ipynb`: α-driven entropy variation
- `MC_SGCV_Coherence_Simulation.ipynb`: primary coherence decay model
- `PsiStar_Energy_Conversion_Simulation.ipynb`: tracks post-decoherence energy flow
- `Phase1` → `Phase4`: modular simulation chain for full pipeline
- `Animated_Phase_Coherence_Dynamics.ipynb`: time evolution of wrapped coherence phase

## 📊 Outputs

- MP4 animations
- PNG heatmaps of field evolution
- Tensor data arrays
- Coherence loss metrics and ghost field structure

## 🧠 Theory Integration

All simulations are based on the following published or in-preparation models:
- **Multifaceted Coherence (MC)**: directional coherence tensor decay
- **SGCV**: superluminal graviton condensate vacuum field
- **DLSFH**: dodecahedral lattice structures (optional)
- **DGQG**: discrete geometric quantum gravity curvature gain

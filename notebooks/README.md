# MC–SGCV Coherence Simulation Suite

Welcome to the central simulation repository for the **Multifaceted Coherence (MC)** and **Superluminal Graviton Condensate Vacuum (SGCV)** research initiative. This repository hosts all interactive notebooks, field simulations, exportable figures, and energy transformation visualizations developed as part of the 2025 MC–SGCV publication suite.

## 🧭 Project Goals

- Simulate coherence decay in observable quantum fields (ψₛ★)
- Track entropy growth and curvature evolution over time
- Visualize how energy redistributes into ghost coherence, vacuum noise, and geometric structure
- Validate hypotheses around directional irreversibility and partial recondensation

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `/notebooks/`: Contains 18 modular simulation notebooks, each with its own subdirectory and `README.md`
- `/figures/`: Output images and visualizations (modulus, phase, ghost, etc.)
- `/exports/`: MP4 animations and time series snapshots
- `/data/`: Saved NumPy or symbolic tensor arrays (optional)
- `/latex/`: LaTeX source for the paper with auto-included figures and citations

| Core | `MC_SGCV_Coherence_Simulation.ipynb` | Central coherence decay and field evolution model |
| Phase 1 | `Phase1_DLSFH_Lattice_MC.ipynb` | Lattice initialization (dodecahedral/dynamic) |
| Phase 2 | `Phase2_MC_Tensor_Evolution.ipynb` | Tensor evolution: Cμν(x,t), entropy S(x,t) |
